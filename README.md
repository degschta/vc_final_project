#Instructions
The project can be run on Google Colab (vc_smile_detection_project_colab_version.ipynb). 
Make sure to replace the paths to the cascade file/image folders/index files as indicated in the Jupyter Notebook file. The cascade file (cascade_w20_h10_numStages20_numPos1000.xml) as well as the image dataset (positives7/negatives7) are located in the root folder.
You can also run the project locally (vc_smile_detection_project.ipynb).
